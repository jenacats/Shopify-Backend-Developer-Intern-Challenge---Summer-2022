# Shopify-Backend-Developer-Intern-Challenge---Summer-2022
Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022

Hi! Thank you for taking a look at my code for this application.

This challenge was done in Java.
In order to run this, download a Java IDE like IntelliJ, DrJava, or jGRASP.
Then download all 3 files. They are called: crud.java, shipment.java, inventoryItem.java
After you download all which is necessary, run crud.java

This program will be completed through the prompt/command line.
Please try to not input wrong types, like Strings where it is expecting an int.
